## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt about the usage of svg tag for importing svg images in web document.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
      width="336"
      height="201"
      fill="none"
      viewBox="0 0 336 201">
</svg>
```
```css
main {
  box-shadow: 6px 6px hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}
```
### Continued development

Rounded corners for the svg image isn't done. Still researching for solution on way forward.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css) - This helped me with css syntax. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand HTML and CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
